# CasinoPlusPlus
CasinoPlusPlus is my way of becomming more familiar with C++ by developing simple casino games. Games are run in-terminal, with confirmed execution via Visual Studio Code run in Windows.

## Current Features

### Main.cpp
Configured to execute a terminal-based game loop, where the user is given their choice of game with three computer players. 

### Games.h and Cards.h
The building blocks for games of chance. Currently only supports BlackJack (With dealer standing on soft 17, and splits not available).

### Players.h and Inventories.h
Simple rpg-esque implementations of characters.


## To-Do
* Enable splitting during BlackJack
* Assign stats to computer players which will influence their play-making (probably not for the better)
* Enable basic save/load features
